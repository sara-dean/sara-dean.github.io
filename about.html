	<h1>Sara R. Dean</h1>
	<p>Sara grew up in Connecticut and graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University in Fall 2016 with a B.A. in history and social sciences. She currently lives in Boston, where she is pursuing an M.A. in history with a concentration in public history.
	<p>
	Sara's recent scholarship has been in the realm of 19th-century American cultural history. In Spring 2017, Sara published an article called "Planting Christian Virtues": Reverend Lucyan Bójnowski and Media Coverage of New Britain’s Polish Immigrant Community, 1897-1916" in Eastern Connecticut State University's history journal, <i>Germina Veris</i>. Her scholarly interests extend beyond the field of history as well--she is currently working on an article about J. R. R. Tolkien's career in philology and its influence on his worldbuilding process in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> process.</p>
