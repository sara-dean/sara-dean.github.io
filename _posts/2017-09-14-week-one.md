Hello, my name is Sara Dean and I am beginning a master's program in public history at Northeastern University this fall. I am taking a class on methods for digital history this semester, and I am looking forward to getting started. I taught myself HTML in grade school, but it has been several years now since I have attempted to use it seriously. This website and blog will probably see many changes as I reacquaint myself with coding.

Before I came to Northeastern, I earned a B.A. in history and social sciences from Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU). ECSU is highly reputed as a teaching college, and I had initially considered becoming a teacher when I started there. Before the school became ECSU, it was known as the State Teachers' College. Pictured above is a postcard of the Teacher's College circa 1930. 

The building in the picture still exists today, with the same stone steps and statues leading up to it. We at ECSU know it as Shafer Hall, and until two years ago it was the campus' fine arts building. It stands on the outskirts of campus, and I can still recall the feeling of walking up and down that windy hill on a winter's day to get to an 8am class. We have a new fine arts facility now, and word is that the school is planning to turn Shafer into a residence hall. I feel pride in the school's heritage and I am grateful that the administration has decided to maintain structures from its past.

I thought I would inaugurate this blog with a bit of history from my hometown. Thanks for reading, and until next time!
