Hi, my name is Sara and I'm a master's student of public history at Northeastern University. This semester, I'm taking a class in methods for digital history, and I'm excited to get started. I taught myself HTML in grade school, but it's been years now since I've used it. This website and blog will probably see many changes as I reacquaint myself with coding.

"State Teachers' College, Willimantic, Conn." Card. 1930. Digital Commonwealth, http://ark.digitalcommonwealth.org/ark:/50959/6t053g751 (accessed September 16, 2017).

Before I came to Northeastern, I earned my bachelor's in history and social sciences from Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU). ECSU has a great reputation as a teaching college, and I'd originally considered becoming a teacher when I first started there. Before it was ECSU, the school was known as the State Teachers' College. Pictured above is a postcard of the Teacher's College circa 1930. 

That building still stands today, with the same stone steps and statues in front of it. We know it as Shafer Hall, and until a year or two ago it was the campus' fine arts building. It was on the outskirts of campus, and there was nothing worse than walking up and down that windy hill on a winter's day to get to a 9am class. We have a new fine arts facility now, and I think the school is planning to turn Shafer into a residence hall. I'm happy to hear that they won't be tearing the building down anytime soon.

Anyway, I thought I would inaugurate this blog with a bit of history from my hometown. Thanks for reading, and until next time!
