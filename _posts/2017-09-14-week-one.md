Welcome to my blog! My name is Sara and I am a first-year master's student of public history at Northeastern University. I did my undergrad at Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU) in Willimantic, Connecticut. Before ECSU existed as it does today, it was known as the State Teachers' College. Pictured above is a postcard of the college, created sometime between 1930 and 1945 (gathered courtesy of the Digital Public Library of America).
