My name is Sara and I'm a master's student of public history at Northeastern University. This semester, I'm taking a class in methods for digital history, and I'm excited to get started. I taught myself HTML in grade school, but it's been years now since I've used it. This website and blog will probably see many changes as I reacquaint myself with website building.

Before I came to Northeastern, I earned a bachelor's degree in history and social sciences at Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU) in Willimantic, Connecticut. ECSU has a great reputation as a teaching college, and I'd originally considered becoming a teacher when I first started there. Before ECSU was ECSU, it was known as the State Teachers' College. Pictured above is a postcard of the college circa 1930, courtesy of the Digital Public Library of America. I think this is a great picture because that building is still standing today, with the same stone steps and statues in front of it. We know it as Shafer Hall, and until a year or two ago it was the campus' fine arts building. It was on the outskirts of our campus, and there was nothing worse than walking up and down that windy hill on a winter's day to get to your 9am class. We have a new fine arts facility now, and last I heard, the school was planning to turn Shafer into a residence hall.
