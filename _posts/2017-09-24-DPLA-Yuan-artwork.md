title: "What Yuan Artwork Can Teach Us About DPLA's Collections"

Browsing the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) website with expectations fueled by statistics about the magnitude of its collections (17 million items contributed by 1,200 contributing institutions in the United States) complicated the process of selecting a subset of images to investigate further. Overly optimistic about the database’s holdings, I searched for various types of content that I was interested and was disappointed to find few results. While it is understandable that the database has its limitations, it shows the need for further expansion before it can be considered a comprehensive source. For the time being, users like me are constrained by what DPLA and its contributing institutions consider worthy of sharing.


Had I wanted to learn more about plantae, I would have had an easy time of it (the database has 1,010,030 items under that category). However, I initially thought I would try to follow up on a topic that I published a paper about as an undergraduate: Polish immigration to Connecticut at the turn of the twentieth century. I did not expect to find content that was directly in line with what I wrote about in my paper, but I hoped to learn something loosely relevant to the subject. I browsed under the subject category of “immigrants” and hoped to use a “Connecticut” location modifier on the results. However, there is no content on “immigrants” for the state of Connecticut in DPLA. Other subjects that I was interested in, like “newspapers” and “Native Americans” in Connecticut returned only 6 or 7 results, some of them duplicates of one another (in addition to “Native Americans” there was a subject called “Indians of North America,” and while this returned a couple dozen results, they were mostly duplicates again). I grew up in Connecticut and would like to do some research on Connecticut history, but apparently the state gets limited attention from DPLA and its contributors (compared to, say, plantae). When I tried browsing by a Connecticut location first, and seeing what kinds of subjects appeared afterwards, I found that there was a substantial amount of content for subjects like certain people (e.g. Judson Whitlocke Lyons); plants, vegetables, and fruit; and coins, currency, and medals. The constraints of the kinds of materials institutions want to contribute (and the institutions that are contributing in the first place) means that I can’t search for anything that I find interesting on DPLA. I am girded in by the partnerships DPLA has with other institutions.


In order to find a subset of images that might yield more substantial results, I thought back to topics that had interested me in my history classes. Recalling a course I took at Eastern Connecticut State University called “Turks and Mongols” where we briefly looked at Chinese art, I decided to investigate this topic further. First, I looked at DPLA’s subject category “Chinese Art,” which happily returned 13,894 hits. There are many approaches to this topic that could make for an interesting analysis or exhibit, including the artworks’ time period, subject matter, media and materials, and how all of those elements might relate to which ethnic group was I power at the time (for example, Yuan art under the Mongols). Interestingly, while the odd painting or calligraphic piece appeared in this search, the majority of results were pottery fragments. This raised further questions for consideration: Why do collections of Chinese art seem to consist primarily of pottery? Is pottery the bulk of what was created, or is it just what people are choosing to post online? Further investigation shed light on this issue.

Within “Chinese Art,” DPLA has a “Yuan Dynasty” subset containing 455 images. I realized that these all belonged to a single collection, the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, via the Smithsonian. I went back to the “Chinese Art” subject search and saw that the 13,894 items there had been contributed by 10 institutions, and that an impressive 13,836 of those were contributed by only one source: the same Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery via the Smithsonian.


As I studied the Yuan period pottery, I found that historical questions naturally arose. I saw that there were reoccurring styles in the pottery: A brown glazed stoneware style from the Quanzhou province, a well-known white and cobalt blue porcelain style from Jingdezhen, a milky blue transparent glaze style from Qingbai. If I were to compose an analysis or an exhibit about these pieces, I would ask questions such as: What does the relationship between artistic style and place say about economic and political relationships in imperial China? Was there a great deal of trade in these pieces across the empire? Since Mongols ruled in China during the Yuan period, how did Mongol tastes influence Chinese art? In aggregate, these images confirm that Chinese art in the Yuan period was closely tied to place; stylistic features like form, color, motifs, and materials varied depending on which province the pottery was produced in. Further historical research might yield interesting insights on the influence of Mongol tastes in Chinese art—and, by extension, Chinese culture—during the period. We might also learn about Chinese cultural exchange in general; though the pieces originated in certain provinces, did they end up in other places due to trade? What does this say about the health of the Chinese economy during the Yuan period?


We might be able to collect more information pertaining to these questions if we looked at a sample more diverse than what DPLA has to offer. Biases dictate what archivists and curators include in these kinds of collections in the first place. Later, people also dictate what is to be digitized. When I followed DPLA’s link to the images’ Freer and Sackler Galleries source, I came to the Smithsonian’s main website. The Smithsonian’s notes on the Yuan artworks’ provenance state that the objects were likely excavated in Cairo between 1912 and 1924 under Aly Bahgat of the Arab Museum of Art. This could explain the prevalence of pottery in the collection, then--it is not that pictorial artworks were not produced in the Yuan period, but only that the Freer and Sackler collection was assembled from stoneware excavations. Interestingly, the pottery's connection to the Arab world also sheds light on the questions of Mongol consumption of Chinese artwork and distribution of Chinese artwork within and without the empire.


When I looked at the Smithsonian's search results for the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, I found that it returned 41,147 different objects. While these items were all digitized on the Smithsonian website, they were not all transferred to DPLA, which only has 13,836 from the same source. Why is that? Did the Smithsonian not want to turn over its entire collection? How did it decide what to withhold and what to give to DPLA? It seems unlikely to me that DPLA would only want to take part of the collection, given its goal of becoming a comprehensive database. That decision would raise questions of its own. 


There is more information about the Freer and Sackler Galleries on another Smithsonian website called The Smithsonian's Museums of Asian Art. A statement about the entire collection emphasizes how selective DPLA's sample of it is:

  
“The Freer and Sackler Galleries boast one of the finest museum collections of Chinese art outside of China, with more than ten thousand objects dating from Neolithic times (ca. 7000–ca. 2000 BCE) to the present. While the sheer number of items is impressive, it is their variety and quality that is truly remarkable, with nearly every medium and category of Chinese art represented” (<a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/chinese.asp">"Collection Highlights: Chinese Art"</a>).

  
Indeed, the Museums of Asian Art website displays four artworks as "collection highlights": These are one bronze bell, one ink landscape on a handscroll, one portrait painting on silk, and one stoneware vase. While other media besides stoneware are represented in both the main Smithsonian site and on DPLA, it is strange given the collection's actual composition that stoneware is featured on those sites so dominantly. DPLA might consider acquisitioning the full contents of the Freer and Sackler Gallery (and others like it) in order to 1) fulfill its goal of being a comprehensive database, and 2) be more faithful in its representation of such collections.
