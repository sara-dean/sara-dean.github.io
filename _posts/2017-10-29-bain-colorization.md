title: Colorizing the George Grantham Bain Collection

As we looked at examples of algorithmic image manipulation, I became interested in AI colorization software. I have experience colorizing black and white images--for example, of Buster Keaton or Dwight Frye--by hand in Photoshop CS, but I was intrigued by the potential of such software to colorize images automatically.

First, I located an image set that I wanted to use. I chose the Library of Congress's George Grantham Bain collection because according to the website, its photos come from "one of America's earliest news picture agencies," and because it had some variety in the types of people depicted in its photographs. In addition to wondering how well the programs could colorize the images, I wondered how they would treat elements like skintone, hair and eye color, clothing, and environment. I downloaded many images from the Bain collection, but decided to hone in on some examples of Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Native American people in order to see how the programs dealt with a variety of skintones and clothing and jewelry styles.

We were forewarned that algorithmic image manipulation remains difficult, and I found this to be true in my efforts. First, I used an online program called Algorithmia, which simply requires users to upload black and white photographs, and then automatically applies fields of color to them. The first image I used was one of young Anastasia Nikolaevna, and the results of this led me to be optimistic. Although the fields of color were large and imprecise, the program distinguished between Anastasia's skin, dress, and the backdrop behind her using fairly distinct color choices. I quickly found that the success of this photograph would not apply to the others. One photograph of a group of Indian girls in a caravan, for instance, has been treated with little more than a sepia-toned wash which makes practically no distinction between their skin, hair, jewelry, clothing, or environment. The others are similar, with the exception of one photograph of a Native American man, in which the program picked up on the green of the trees behind him and splashed some color on his clothing; however, it erroneously placed a blue color behind him, perhaps mistaking the out-of-focus background for a body of water or a sky. This technology has potential, but is so far limited in its ability to identify elements of a photograph in order to determine the colors it should use. It makes little effort to distinguish between skin, hair, eyes, and jewelry, suggesting that it applies a sepia or pink-ish color wash to anything it can identify as being part of a human.

Hoping to achieve better results, I tried a web app called ColorizePhoto. This application is interesting in that it requires users to upload two photographs: the black and white photograph to be edited, and a reference photograph from which to pull colors. In one sense, this was useful in that it did not require me to determine for myself what a "realistic" skin color might be; but in all other senses it was restrictive, because I had to find reference photos that provided all of the colors I needed and I could not come up with my own colors when I wanted to. The app's interface was fairly useful in that it allowed me to control brush size and hardness, as well as opacity. However, it didn't allow me to do anything I couldn't do in Photoshop by setting a layer to the "overlay" mode and painting over a black and white image. Obvious pros are that ColorizePhoto is free whereas Photoshop is rather expensive, and that its simple interface allows users to get the job done more easily than they would if they had to navigate through all of Photoshop's tools and settings. Cons are that it lacks some of the perks of Photoshop, such as pen pressure (if one is using a tablet pen), gradients, the erase tool, and the ability to choose colors freely. All in all, ColorizePhoto is just as laborious as Photoshop in that it requires colorization by hand, but it is a free alternative.

Lastly, I wanted to try out a program called Codijy which allows users to apply color by making brushstrokes rather than filling in areas of color themselves, and also has useful tools like gradients. The website offers a 15-day free trial download which I wanted to use for the purpose of this workset. However, after I had made multiple attempts, the website failed to send the trial to either my personal or my school email address. I thought this was odd because the website doesn't appear to be outdated (it has a 2017 timestamp at the bottom).

Clearly the creators of these technologies see the potential value of modernizing black and white images through colorization, and the programs they have created are promising. But at this stage, while AI is still limited in its intelligence and abilities, good colorization requires the user to put time, effort, and precision into performing it manually.

Working with photographs from a variety of historical and cultural contexts also led me to consider some of the bigger issues facing colorization projects. In order to ensure historical accuracy, it is imperative to first research the original photographs well. When colorizing the photograph of the Native American man in ColorizePhoto, I was troubled by the fact that I did not know which tribe the man belonged to, and that I therefore did not know what kind of reference image to use for his clothing and jewelry. This is an obvious example, given the fact that misrepresentation and appropriation of Native American clothing is a hot topic right now; but I think this kind of research is necessary for all photographic subjects. Take, for instance, the dress in the photograph of Anastasia. Algorithmia colored it yellow, and I decided to make it blue--yet either of these choices might have been incorrect. Sometimes, a written description of a given garment might exist, or the garment itself may have been preserved; other times, colors might have particular symbolic meaning. It is important not to use colorization as a gimmick to lure in modern audiences, but to use it conscientiously.
