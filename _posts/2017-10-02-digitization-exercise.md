I did not have success at guessing which items in my home or local library might be digitized. Books I'd initially expected not to be on the web, such as Merrill's 1893 edition of the works of Roman poet Catullus
(although I was sure that later editions would have been digitized), an 1870 text called <i>A Book About Roses: How to Grow and Show Them</i> by S. Reynolds Hole, and a seemingly obscure texxt in the Boston Public Library called <i>Union of the Boston Athenaeum and the Public Library</i> 
had, surprisingly, been digitized already by at least one source. I checked many other books that did not make it onto this list. Frustratingly, I often thought I had a promising lead only to find that a book had been "rediscovered" by a London-based publisher
called Forgotten Books, and subsequently popularized on the web.

I would guess that both library collections policies and digitization efforts favor books with established value, popularity, or significance, 
which makes it not-so-surprising after all that there would be so much overlap between the two. When one considers that books published before 1922 (therefore out of copyright)
are a finite resource, furthermore, it makes sense that many of these have been digitized already. Google's attempts to partner with libraries in order to scan millions of books
was a major obstacle to this project as well.

Although we were advised against doing online searches for this project, I had little success in my many attempts to find undigitized books
"organically," so I decided to search for items that I felt were particularly unlikely to have been digitized. I recalled my frustration at finding very little on Connecticut/Massachusetts cultural history (especially regarding immigrants and Native Americans)
on DPLA. so I reasoned that there might also be a scarcity in digitized print about those subjects. This technique was successful, and I was able to find a book in the Boston
Public Library that was written by a member of the Connecticut Valley Historical Society about Native Americans in 1991. From what I have been able to 
determine, the piece has never before been digitized. It is called <i>Minnetona; Or, The Indian Gift</i> and a digitized version of the first part of the piece can be found <a href="https://sara-dean.github.io/Minnetona.txt">here</a>.
