title: "An Exercise in Crowdsourcing with Trove"

In my last practical exercise in Digital History, I found an undigitized book in the Boston Public Library, scanned its pages, and used OCR to create a text file from the scans. I was fortunate in that the OCR output was fairly accurate, with the exception of some formatting errors and letter substitutions.

The problem with OCR is that it is not always reliable or accurate. In order to ensure accuracy, the OCR output needs to be compared to the original text. Sometimes, if the output is especially inaccurate, the user is better served by typing the text out from scratch rather than trying to correct the OCR-generated text. Because of the technology's present limitations, putting out unchecked OCR text for public use is risky. If one is trying to put out a large volume of digitized material, however, manually checking OCR becomes time-consuming.

The National Library of Australia (NLA) has attempted to deal with this issue through crowdsourcing. Through its online repository, Trove, NLA encourages users to supply the time and labor needed to check OCR outputs on digitized newspapers from the 1800s to the present. A quick glance through these newspapers demonstrates the need for this program; some OCR outputs, like the one for an article called "Aboriginal Languages" in the 27 August 1918 edition of the Brisbane Courier, are mostly unintelligible.

Trove invites all of the help it can get in this endeavor. There is a page of guidelines for participants, but not much restricting their actions. They may register an account or work anonymously; change, add, or delete text as they wish; make private or public comments; create tags for the articles; and more.

Although the OCR output for "Aboriginal Languages" was illegible, the image scan of the newspaper was fairly clear, and I had little difficulty in reading it in order to make my corrections. However, the OCR was so inaccurate that I found it more practical to rewrite entire sentences from scratch. I found the interface for text correction to be quite user-friendly, and I was able to jump right into the process.

<b>A sentence from the original OCR output of "Aboriginal Language"</b>: "Ali P Bonnett B-«. icad n jnpet on The \ocahiiaiy nf tin Aft nut «¡pincel Phil«« it a meeting of the Rojal Ninety it the Uiivei-itv i i=t cv«nin¿"

<b>My correction, based on my own reading of the article scan</b>: "Mr. F. Bennett B.Sc., read a paper on "The Vocabulary of the Mount Spencer Blacks" at a meeting of the Royal Society at the University last evening."

When the article comes up in a search, it now reads: "Text last corrected on 15 October 2017 by *anon*[NLA]." The article can be found <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20269376">here</a>. 

So far, Trove reports that 245,628,218 lines of text have been corrected by 49,104 correctors (I don't know if this only counts registered users, or if it keeps track of anonymous participants as well). Trove makes an effort to keep participants engaged by publishing a Text Correction Hall of Fame on its website. This appears to have had some success--the user ranked #1 on the leaderboard has corrected 4,677,385 lines of text so far, and I personally kept coming across a user called TheWorldsGreatestTroveCorrector in my searches for articles containing the keyword "aboriginal."

Users who wish to save the sources have several options: They can print as image or text; share to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, tumblr, or Reddit; purchase high quality photocopies or electronic copies; or download the article, page, or issue as a JPG, PDF, or TXT file. In general, Trove seems committed to making its materials accessible to the public.

Technology and funding permitting, the program could be improved in the future by implementing measures to ensure that users follow the standards outlined in the guidelines. At the moment, they act only as suggestions. Since the purpose of having users correct OCR outputs is quality control, there should be some measure in place to perform quality control on the users' work.

I would be willing to participate in the crowdsourcing effort more in the future, and I would be interested to see if Trove makes any changes or improvements to the program.
